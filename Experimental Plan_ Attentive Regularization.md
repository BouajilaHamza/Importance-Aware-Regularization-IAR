# Experimental Plan: Attentive Regularization

## Objective
To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed Attentive Regularization technique in improving neural network performance and understanding the learned importance scores. We will compare its performance against standard regularization methods and analyze the behavior of the attention module.

## Datasets
- MNIST: For initial prototyping and quick experimentation.
- CIFAR-10: For more challenging image classification tasks to assess scalability and generalization.

## Model Architecture
- A simple Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for MNIST.
- A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) (e.g., a small VGG-like or ResNet-like architecture) for CIFAR-10.

## Regularization Baselines
We will compare Attentive Regularization against the following established regularization techniques:

1.  **No Regularization**: A baseline model trained without any explicit regularization.
2.  **L2 Regularization (Weight Decay)**: Standard L2 regularization applied to all weights with a fixed `lambda`.
3.  **Dropout**: Randomly setting a fraction of input units to zero at each update during training.
4.  **DropAttention (Hypothetical)**: A hypothetical baseline where attention scores are fixed (e.g., random or uniform) rather than learned, to isolate the effect of the learnable attention mechanism.

## Experimental Protocol

### Training Details
-   **Optimizer**: Adam optimizer.
-   **Learning Rate Schedule**: Cosine annealing or step decay.
-   **Epochs**: Sufficient epochs to ensure convergence for all models (e.g., 50-100 for MNIST, 100-200 for CIFAR-10).
-   **Batch Size**: Standard batch sizes (e.g., 64 or 128).
-   **Hardware**: Training will be performed on a single GPU (if available) or CPU.

### Evaluation Metrics
-   **Test Accuracy**: The primary metric for evaluating model performance.
-   **Training Loss & Validation Loss**: To monitor convergence and identify overfitting.
-   **Attention Score Distribution**: Histograms and heatmaps of learned attention scores for different layers over training epochs to visualize their evolution and distribution.
-   **Weight Magnitude Distribution**: Histograms of weight magnitudes to observe the effect of regularization.

## Ablation Studies

To understand the contribution of different components of Attentive Regularization, we will perform the following ablation studies:

1.  **Fixed vs. Learned Attention**: Compare the performance of Attentive Regularization with a version where the attention scores are fixed (e.g., all 0.5, or randomly initialized and kept constant) to a version where they are learned. This will highlight the benefit of dynamic attention.
2.  **Different Forms of Attention Module**: Experiment with variations in the attention module's architecture (e.g., number of layers, activation functions, input features to the attention module) to see their impact on performance and learned scores.
3.  **Impact of `lambda`**: Analyze the sensitivity of Attentive Regularization to the `lambda` hyperparameter, which controls the overall regularization strength.

## Reporting

For each experiment, we will report:
-   Test accuracy (mean and standard deviation over multiple runs).
-   Training and validation loss curves.
-   Visualizations of attention score distributions and weight importance heatmaps at different training stages.
-   Ablation study results, clearly showing the impact of each component.

## Expected Outcomes

We expect Attentive Regularization to achieve comparable or superior performance to traditional regularization methods, especially in scenarios where certain weights are genuinely more important than others. The attention score visualizations should provide insights into which weights the model deems important and how these perceptions evolve during training.
